# What Does it Do?
It allows you to orchestrate multiple Jenkins pipeline/job builds from one location. For example, you can kick off a pipeline which runs Jenkify which will then kick off 25 Jenkins jobs/pipelines and track the status of each of them until error or completion of all of the builds.
